# Quick Fix Applied! ?

## Problem Solved

**Error 126** (DLL not found) has been fixed!

## What Was Changed

### 1. Fixed `test/test_dll.cpp`
- Now loads DLL from current directory first
- Falls back to relative path if needed
- Better error messages
- User-friendly output

### 2. Updated `test/CMakeLists.txt`
- **Auto-copies `native.dll`** to test build directory
- No more relative path issues!
- Works every time after build

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Clear error messages
- Solution suggestions
- Graceful fallback

## How to Use Now

### Option 1: Simple Run (Recommended)
```cmd
cd test\build
test_dll.exe
```

That's it! The DLL is already in the same directory.

### Option 2: Use Scripts
```cmd
cd test
build_and_run.bat
```

or

```cmd
cd test
run.bat
```

## File Structure

```
test/build/
©À©¤©¤ test_dll.exe     # Test program (93 KB)
©À©¤©¤ native.dll   # Auto-copied DLL (85 KB)
©¸©¤©¤ ...   # Other build files
```

## Benefits of This Fix

? **No more path issues** - DLL is in the same directory  
? **Auto-copy on build** - Always up-to-date  
? **Better error messages** - Easy to debug  
? **Works every time** - Reliable execution  

## Rebuilding

If you rebuild the main DLL:

```cmd
# 1. Rebuild main project
cd build
cmake --build .

# 2. Rebuild test (will auto-copy new DLL)
cd ..\test\build
cmake --build .

# 3. Run
test_dll.exe
```

## Technical Details

### Auto-Copy Command in CMakeLists.txt
```cmake
add_custom_command(TARGET test_dll POST_BUILD
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_if_different
        "${MAIN_DLL_PATH}"
        "$<TARGET_FILE_DIR:test_dll>/native.dll"
    COMMENT "Copying native.dll to test build directory"
)
```

This runs after every successful build and copies the DLL if it changed.

### DLL Loading Strategy in test_dll.cpp
```cpp
// 1. Try current directory (where DLL was copied)
HMODULE hDll = LoadLibrary(L"native.dll");

// 2. If fails, try relative path
if (!hDll) {
    hDll = LoadLibrary(L"../../build/native.dll");
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load native.dll from current directory"
**Don't worry!** The program will try the relative path automatically.

### "Still failed. Error code: 126"
**Solutions:**
1. Rebuild main project: `cd build && cmake --build .`
2. Rebuild test project: `cd test\build && cmake --build .`
3. Check if `build\native.dll` exists

### DLL is outdated
**Solution:** Just rebuild test project, it will auto-copy the latest DLL.

## Success! ??

The test program is now ready to use. Just run `test_dll.exe` from the `test\build` directory!
